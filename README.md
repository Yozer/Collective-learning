# Collective-learning

Simulation written in C# as project for classes (Modeling and System Simulation). 
Topic: "Collective learning and population growth".

Each agent has its own knowledge (which they share depending on settings) and the goal for whole population is to survive as long as possible.

I've used SFML for drawing.
